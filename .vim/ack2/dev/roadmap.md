# Ack2 Roadmap

# All options have to be able to say where they came from

# Get ack -f working

* Get option-handling working
* Implement file-finding object
* Bring over -f tests
* Make all -f tests pass
* Inclusion of dirs
* Exclusion of dirs
* Inclusion of files
* Exclusion of files

# Implement search functionality (or bring it over from Ack1)

* Create file/resource objects

## Make sure all previous command options are supported (this clearly needs fleshing out)

## Add --check option (for verifying that your ackrc is OK)
