# When: 2011-09-06 14:00 America/Chicago

Andy Lester (@petdance) and Rob Hoelz (@hoelzro) are meeting in
person for a mini ackathon.  We'll also be following irc://irc.perl.org/ack
for anyone interested in attending remotely.

# Agenda

* Go over Rob's ConfigFinder implementation.
* Discuss the use of Test::Deep in the test suite.
    * Can we have non-core test-only modules?
* Discuss a roadmap for after Rob completes ConfigLoader.

# Notes/minutes

* Keep Rob's ConfigFinder, and expand out some of the rules.  Drop
support for $ACKRC.  Fold in the documentation.

* Replace Rob's ConfigLoader with the stuff that Andy had already
written back in February.  Andy is starting tests for
App::Ack::ConfigLoader.
